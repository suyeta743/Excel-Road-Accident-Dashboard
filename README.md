•	This is an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze and visualize road accident data.

•	Implemented a filter panel to enable users to filter data by year and area (rural or urban) and used cards to display key statistics on casualties.

•	Developed charts, including a line with bar chart and clustered bar chart, to show patterns and insights in the data.

•	Utilized donut charts to present the number of casualties by area and light condition, demonstrating proficiency in data visualization techniques





The main goal of this project was to create an interactive and comprehensive dashboard capable of analyzing and visualizing road accident data, specifically focusing on the number and types of casualties in different areas and over different time periods.

To achieve this goal, I developed several features in the dashboard, including a filter panel that enabled users to filter data by year and area (rural or urban), key statistics cards on the number and percentages of total casualties, fetal casualties, serious casualties, slight casualties, and casualties by cars. I also created another card that displayed the total number of casualties by different types of vehicles.

To provide a more comprehensive view of the data, I utilized a line with bar chart graph to compare the current year and previous year's casualties. Furthermore, I employed a clustered bar chart to show the number of casualties by road type and a chart to show the number of casualties by road surface.

I also incorporated donut charts to showcase the number of casualties by area and light condition. These charts provided a clear and concise overview of the data insights, allowing stakeholders to quickly understand the key trends and patterns.

In conclusion, this Excel Road Accident Dashboard project showcases my proficiency in Excel and data visualization techniques, as well as my ability to analyze complex datasets and present actionable insights in a visually appealing and easily understandable format.
